## Description
<!-- What does this change and why? -->


## Test Plan
<!-- How did you verify this works? -->


## Checklist
- [ ] Lua libraries (`lua/awful/`, `lua/gears/`, `lua/wibox/`, `lua/naughty/`) are **not modified** — if a bug surfaces in Lua, the fix belongs in C
- [ ] Tests pass (`make test-unit && make test-integration`)
